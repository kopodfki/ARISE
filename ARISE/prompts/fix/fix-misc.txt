Please correct the miscellaneous agents description in the following Scenic 3.0 code, using the provided examples and adhering to their syntax. Make sure not to remove the commets that are identifying the code parts, e.g. #START BEHAVIOR, #END BEHAVIOR

Current description: {current_description}

Snippet examples: {content}

Make use of the examples and adhere to the syntax used in them. You must use only the following position specifiers and none other, do not combine the specifiers:

  - `at (OrientedPoint, Object)`; Example: `pedestrian = new Pedestrian at pedestrianSpawnPoint`
  - `in (region)`, e.g., `network.drivableRegion`, `network.walkableRegion`, `network.crossingRegion`; Example: `pedestrian = new Pedestrian in network.walkableRegion`
  - `on (region, Object, vector)`; Example: `AdvAgent = new Car on road`
  - `at (OrientedPoint, Object) offset by (vector)`; Example: `pedestrian = new Pedestrian at pedestrianSpawnPoint offset by Vector(2, 2)`
  - `at (OrientedPoint, Object) offset along (direction) by (vector)`; Example: `pedestrian = new Pedestrian at AdvAgent offset along (AdvAgent.heading) by Vector(2, 2)`
  - `(left or right) of (vector or OrientedPoint or Object) [by scalar]`; Example: `pedestrian = new Pedestrian left of AdvAgent by 5`
  - `(ahead of or behind) (vector or OrientedPoint or Object) [by scalar]`; Example: `pedestrian = new Pedestrian ahead of AdvAgent by 5`
  - `following (vectorField) [from (vector, Object, OrientedPoint)] for scalar`; Example: `AdvAgent = new Car following roadDirection from ego for 5`
  - to retrieve the adjacent left / right lane of another Agent, use following: `AdvAgent = new Car on ego.laneSection.(laneToLeft or laneToRight)`
Square brackets denote the optional arguments, and the curly braces denote the choice from the options.

The code fails to compile with the following error message: {error_message}
