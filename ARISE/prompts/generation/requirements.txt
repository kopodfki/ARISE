Now, your task is to help write part of the Scenic code for defining the requirements given the corresponding description.
Here is the scenario description: {current_description}
Here is the code snippet which defines the objects in the scene: {scenic_code}
Here are some exmaples of the requirements:
1. initially ego should not see the pedestrian: ```scenic\n require not ego.canSee(pedestrian, occludingObjects=tuple([])) # Make sure to replace the empty list with a list of all other simulation agents```
2. intially ego should see the adversarial vehicle: ```scenic\n require ego.canSee(AdvAgent, occludingObjects=tuple([])) # Make sure to replace the empty list with a list of all other simulation agents```
3. eventually ego and adversarial vehicle should be in the intersection ```scenic\n require eventually ego in intersection implies AdvAgent in intersection```
4. eventually ego should see the adversarial vehicle: ```scenic\n require eventually ego.canSee(AdvAgent, occludingObjects=tuple([])) # Make sure to replace the empty list with a list of all other simulation agents``` 
5. eventually distance between ego and adversarial vehicle should be less than 10: ```scenic\n require eventually distance from ego to AdvAgent < 10```
6. eventually pedestrian should be in the drivable region: ```scenic\n require eventually pedestrian in network.drivableRegion```
7. intially pedestrian should be in the walkable region: ```scenic\n require pedestrian in network.walkableRegion```
8. ego is at / near the intersection: ```scenic\n require distance from ego to intersection < 10```
9. initial heading of an adversarial vehicle is right relative to ego; ```scenic\n require 70 deg <= RelativeHeading(AdvAgent, ego) <= 110 deg```
10. initial heading of an adversarial vehicle is left relative to ego; ```scenic\n require -110 deg <= RelativeHeading(AdvAgent, ego) <= -70 deg```
11. initial heading of an adversarial vehicle is the same as ego; ```scenic\n require -10 deg <= RelativeHeading(AdvAgent, ego) <= 10 deg```
12. initial ego's view of adversarial agent is obstructed by miscellaneous agent; ```scenic\n require ego.canSee(AdvAgent) and not ego.canSee(AdvAgent, occludingObjects=tuple([MiscAgent])) # checks if ego can not see AdvAgent and can see AdvAgent with occludingObjects as MiscAgent```

Your task is to write the requirements based on the above examples and the scenario description. Requirements should not contain word initially or initial.
Here are the requirements: {requirements}

Make sure to return the scenic code only, without any additional text or explanation. Wrap the code in a code block.
